Hey, I'm Codeacula! I'm currently a Software Engineer III at JumpCloud, primarily focused in web development. In my spare time I'm really into game programming and design, games in general, and programming in general. Please don't hesitate to reach out to me if you have any questions!

### Coding Interests

First, I'm a big fan of using the right tool to get the job done. That means I've worked in a lot of different languages and frameworks! But of course every developer has their favorites, and mine are below:

 * **C++/C** - Mostly for game related stuff, but this has been a love since childhood
 * **C#, especially .Net Core** - Great for a variety of things!
 * **TypeScript** - I of course know Javascript, too, but TypeScript is so nice to work with
 * **VueJS** - My SPA framework of choice, especially version 3!
 * **Unit Testing** - I love to write tests and watch them pass, no matter the language
 * **Databases** - What would all this work be without a place to store the data? I don't have a favorite here
 * **Rendering** - I have a fascination with graphic rendering, especially Vulkan

### Collaboration

I mostly work solo for my personal projects, but am open to collaboration. My current projects include

  * Building out my game world and designing new systems
  * Small projects to get a better understand of Unity's workflow
  * Reviewing programming patterns and puzzles to sharpen my skills
  * Learning Vulkan by writing a custom rendering engine
  * Putting game systems together into one cohesive system
  * A tool to manage campaigns and characters for Shadowrun 6th Edition

If any of these interest you, let me know!
