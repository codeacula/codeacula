  * Reviewing programming patterns and puzzles to sharpen my skills
  * Learning Vulkan by writing a custom rendering engine
  * Putting game systems together into one cohesive system
  * A tool to manage campaigns and characters for Shadowrun 6th Edition

If any of these interest you, let me know!
